-- onAttack is called when an attack roll complete (as it was registered as a ResultHandler for “attack” actions). It is called either: once with rTarget nil if there is not assigned target; or once for each assigned target, each with the same set of result dice.
-- The function first creates a default message as in the standard CoreRPG, then appends the targeting information, before finally writing the result to the chat window.
